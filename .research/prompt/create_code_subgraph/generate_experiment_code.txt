Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher generating complete, executable code for research paper experiments with Hydra configuration management.

Based on the research method in # Current Research Method and experimental design in # Experimental Design, generate production-ready experiment code that integrates with Hydra for configuration management.

# Instructions: Complete Experiment Code Generation

## Core Requirements
- COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION: Every component must be fully functional, production-ready, publication-worthy code. No "omitted for brevity", no "simplified version", no TODO, PLACEHOLDER, pass, or ...
- PYTORCH EXCLUSIVELY: Use PyTorch as the deep learning framework
- HYDRA INTEGRATION: Use Hydra to manage all experiment configurations from `config/run/*.yaml` files. Use `config_path="../config"` in all @hydra.main decorators
- COMPLETE DATA PIPELINE: Full data loading and preprocessing implementation. Use `.cache/` as the cache directory for all datasets and models (e.g., for HuggingFace, set `cache_dir=".cache/"`)
- WANDB REQUIRED: WandB is mandatory for metrics logging (except trial_mode validation)

## Hydra Configuration Structure
Each run config file (`config/run/{run_id}.yaml`) contains:
- run_id: Unique identifier for this run
- method: The method name (baseline, proposed, ablation, etc.)
- model: Model-specific parameters (name, architecture details, hyperparameters)
- dataset: Dataset-specific parameters (name, preprocessing settings, split ratios)
- training: Training hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, optimizer settings, validation split)
- optuna: Hyperparameter search space definition for Optuna optimization

## Command Line Interface
The generated code must support the following CLI:

**Training (main.py):**
```bash
# Full experiment with WandB logging
uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=full

# Trial mode (validation only, WandB disabled)
uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=trial
```
- `run`: Experiment run_id (matching a run_id from config/run/*.yaml)
- `results_dir`: Output directory (passed from GitHub Actions workflow)
- `mode`: Execution mode (required parameter)
  * `mode=trial`: Lightweight execution for validation (epochs=1, batches limited to 1-2, wandb.mode=disabled, optuna.n_trials=0)
  * `mode=full`: Full experiment execution (wandb.mode=online, full epochs, full Optuna trials)
  * **Code must automatically configure based on mode (e.g., `if cfg.mode == "trial": cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"; cfg.optuna.n_trials = 0` elif `cfg.mode == "full": cfg.wandb.mode = "online"`)**

**Evaluation (evaluate.py, independent execution):**
```bash
uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2", ...]'
```
- `results_dir`: Directory containing experiment metadata and where outputs will be saved
- `run_ids`: JSON string list of run IDs to evaluate (e.g., '["run-1-proposed-bert-glue", "run-2-baseline-bert-glue"]')
- Executed as a separate workflow after all training runs complete
- **NOT called from main.py**

## Script Structure (ExperimentCode format)
Generate complete code for these files ONLY. Do not create any additional files beyond this structure:

**`src/train.py`**: Single experiment run executor
- Uses Hydra config to load all parameters
- Called as subprocess by main.py
- Responsibilities:
  * Train model with given configuration
  * Initialize WandB: `wandb.init(entity=cfg.wandb.entity, project=cfg.wandb.project, id=cfg.run.run_id, config=OmegaConf.to_container(cfg, resolve=True), resume="allow")`
  * Skip `wandb.init()` if `cfg.wandb.mode == "disabled"` (trial_mode)
  * **Optuna Integration**: If using Optuna for hyperparameter search, DO NOT log intermediate trial results to WandB - only train once with the best hyperparameters after optimization completes and log that final run
  * **Log ALL metrics to WandB comprehensively**:
    - Use `wandb.log()` at each training step/batch/epoch with ALL relevant metrics
    - Log as frequently as possible (per-batch or per-epoch) to capture training dynamics
    - Use CONSISTENT metric names across train.py and evaluate.py (e.g., if train.py logs "train_acc", evaluate.py MUST use run.history(keys=["train_acc",...]))
  * **Save final/best metrics to WandB summary**:
    - Use `wandb.summary["key"] = value` for final results
  * Print WandB run URL to stdout
- **NO results.json, no stdout JSON output, no figure generation**

**`src/evaluate.py`**: Independent evaluation and visualization script
- **Execution**: Run independently via `uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2"]'`
- **NOT called from main.py** - executes as separate workflow after all training completes
- **Responsibilities**:
  * Parse command line arguments:
    - `results_dir`: Output directory path
    - `run_ids`: JSON string list of run IDs (parse with `json.loads(args.run_ids)`)
  * Load WandB config from `config/config.yaml` (in repository root)
  * **Retrieve comprehensive experimental data from WandB API** for specified run_ids:
    ```python
    import json
    api = wandb.Api()
    run_ids = json.loads(args.run_ids)  # Parse JSON string to list
    for run_id in run_ids:
        run = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}")
        history = run.history()  # pandas DataFrame with ALL time-series metrics (train_loss, val_acc, etc.)
        summary = run.summary._json_dict  # Final/best metrics (best_val_acc, final_test_acc, etc.)
        config = dict(run.config)  # Run configuration (hyperparameters, model settings, etc.)
    ```
  * **STEP 1: Per-Run Processing** (for each run_id):
    - Export **comprehensive** run-specific metrics to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/metrics.json`
    - Generate run-specific figures (learning curves, confusion matrices) to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/`
    - Each run should have its own subdirectory with its metrics and figures
  * **STEP 2: Aggregated Analysis** (after processing all runs):
    - Export aggregated metrics to: `{results_dir}/comparison/aggregated_metrics.json`
    - Compute secondary/derived metrics (e.g., improvement rate: (proposed - baseline) / baseline)
    - Generate comparison figures to: `{results_dir}/comparison/`:
      * Cross-run comparison charts (bar charts, box plots)
      * Performance metrics tables
      * Statistical significance tests
  * **Figure Generation Guidelines**:
    - Use matplotlib or seaborn with proper legends, annotations, tight_layout
    - For line graphs: annotate significant values (final/best values)
    - For bar graphs: annotate values above each bar
    - Use GLOBALLY UNIQUE image filenames to prevent collisions across different runs and directories**:
      * Per-run figures: `{run_id}_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `run-1-proposed-bert-glue_learning_curve.pdf`)
      * Comparison figures: `comparison_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `comparison_accuracy_bar_chart.pdf`)
  * Print all generated file paths to stdout (both per-run and comparison)

**`src/preprocess.py`**: Complete preprocessing pipeline implementation for the specified datasets

**`src/model.py`**: Complete model architecture implementations for all methods (proposed and comparative methods)

**`src/main.py`**: Main orchestrator
- Receives run_id via Hydra, launches train.py as subprocess, manages logs
- **DOES NOT call evaluate.py** (evaluate.py runs independently in separate workflow)
- Use `@hydra.main(config_path="../config")` since execution is from repository root
- **Mode handling**: Automatically configure based on `cfg.mode`:
  * When `cfg.mode == "trial"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"`, `cfg.optuna.n_trials = 0`, epochs=1, etc.
  * When `cfg.mode == "full"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"` and use full configuration

**`config/config.yaml`**: Main Hydra configuration file
- MUST include WandB configuration:
  ```yaml
  wandb:
    entity: gengaru617-personal
    project: 251106-test
    mode: online  # Automatically set to "disabled" in trial_mode
  ```
- `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable is automatically available for authentication

**`pyproject.toml`**: Complete project dependencies
- MUST include: `hydra-core`, `wandb` (required)
- Include as needed: `optuna`, `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, etc.


## Key Implementation Focus Areas
1. **Hydra-Driven Configuration**: All parameters loaded from run configs dynamically
2. **Algorithm Core**: Full implementation of the proposed method with proper abstraction
3. **Mode-Based Behavior**: Code must automatically configure based on `cfg.mode` ("trial" vs "full")
   - `mode=trial`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode="disabled"`, `cfg.optuna.n_trials=0`, epochs=1, limited batches
   - `mode=full`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode="online"`, use full configuration
4. **Run Execution**: main.py executes a single run_id passed via CLI (GitHub Actions dispatches multiple runs separately)
5. **WandB Integration**: All metrics logged to WandB; train.py does NOT output JSON to stdout or save results.json
6. **Independent Evaluation**: evaluate.py runs separately, fetches data from WandB API, generates all figures

open_problems='AdaLoRA shows that allocating the same LoRA rank to every weight matrix is sub-optimal, but its SVD-based importance metric (sensitivity + uncertainty on every singular triplet) costs an extra 11-16 % training time and requires additional code that is hard to port.

# Current Research Method
Gradient-Norm Aware Rank Allocation for LoRA (GLoRA)
1. Keep the ordinary LoRA parameterisation W  ←  W  +  Δ where Δ=AB^T,  rank r.
2. During the first Twarmup optimisation steps record, for every trainable weight matrix k, the exponential-moving-average (EMA) of its LoRA gradient Frobenius norm:  g_k  ←  β·g_k  +  (1-β)·||∂L/∂Δ_k||_F.
3. After warm-up compute importance scores  s_k  =  g_k / Σ_j g_j.
4. Given a global rank budget Rtotal (e.g. 128), assign matrix-specific ranks  r_k  =  round( Rtotal · s_k ).  Ensure Σ_k r_k  =  Rtotal by adding / removing 1 where needed.
5. Re-initialise each LoRA layer with its new rank (easy because LoRA stores A∈ℝ^{d×r}, B∈ℝ^{d×r}).  The already learned sub-matrices for the kept columns are copied; extra columns are created with the same init as LoRA; dropped columns are discarded.  Training then continues normally.

Why it should work: the gradient norm is a first-order estimate of how much the loss would change if the associated parameters were perturbed. It therefore correlates with parameter importance but is essentially free to compute (it is produced anyway by back-prop).  Unlike AdaLoRA we do not need an SVD or per-singular-value statistics, so no extra forward / backward passes are introduced.

# Experimental Design
- Summary: We will verify that the inexpensive gradient-norm aware rank allocation strategy for LoRA (GLoRA) can recover almost all the accuracy benefit of AdaLoRA while keeping training cost identical to vanilla LoRA.  The experiment fine-tunes the encoder-only DeBERTa-v3-base model on the MNLI portion of GLUE using three different parameter-efficient fine-tuning schemes:  (1) ordinary LoRA with a fixed rank of 8 for every projection matrix; (2) AdaLoRA, the published adaptive-rank baseline; (3) the proposed GLoRA.  All runs share the same optimisation schedule and global LoRA-rank budget.  During the first warm-up epoch GLoRA keeps a running EMA of the Frobenius norm of each LoRA gradient; the resulting scores are used to redistribute the fixed total rank across layers.  Because the signal is collected during the normal backward pass, no extra training steps or SVDs are introduced.  At the warm-up boundary the LoRA modules are rebuilt with their newly assigned ranks and training proceeds for the remaining epochs.  We measure development-set accuracy and Matthews correlation on MNLI and record wall-clock training time on one A100 to demonstrate that GLoRA matches AdaLoRA’s accuracy with LoRA-level speed.
