Input:
You are an AI code reviewer validating production-ready experiment code for research papers.

Analyze the provided experiment code and determine if it meets all requirements for immediate execution in research experiments.

# Instructions

## Core Validation Criteria
Check if the generated experiment code meets ALL of the following requirements:

1. **Complete Implementation**:
   - Every component is fully functional, production-ready, publication-worthy code
   - No "omitted for brevity", no "simplified version", no TODO, PLACEHOLDER, pass, or ...
   - All functions and classes are completely implemented
   - No truncated code sections or incomplete implementations

2. **Hydra Integration**:
   - Uses Hydra to manage all experiment configurations from `config/run/*.yaml` files
   - All parameters are loaded from run configs dynamically
   - Proper configuration structure with run_id, method, model, dataset, training, and optuna sections
   - CLI interface matches:
     * Training (full): `uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=full`
     * Training (trial): `uv run python -u -m src.main run={run_id} results_dir={path} mode=trial`
     * Evaluation: `uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2", ...]'` (independent execution)
   - Code must automatically configure based on mode:
     * When `cfg.mode == "trial"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"`, `cfg.optuna.n_trials = 0`, epochs=1
     * When `cfg.mode == "full"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"` and use full configuration

3. **Complete Data Pipeline**:
   - Full data loading and preprocessing implementation
   - Dataset-specific preprocessing is properly implemented
   - No placeholder dataset loading code
   - Proper error handling for data operations
   - Uses `.cache/` as the cache directory for all datasets and models

4. **Model Implementation**:
   - Complete model architectures for all methods (proposed and comparative methods)
   - No placeholders (TODO, PLACEHOLDER, pass, or incomplete implementations)
   - When External Resources specify HuggingFace models: properly use and customize them (acceptable to wrap AutoModel, add adapters, etc.)
   - When no external models specified: implement architectures from scratch using PyTorch primitives
   - Model-specific configurations correctly applied
   - Proper PyTorch usage throughout

5. **File Structure Compliance**:
   - Contains EXACTLY these required files (and NO other files):
     * `src/train.py`
     * `src/evaluate.py`
     * `src/preprocess.py`
     * `src/model.py`
     * `src/main.py`
     * `pyproject.toml`
     * `config/config.yaml`
   - NO additional files (e.g., NO `src/__init__.py`, NO `setup.py`, NO other Python files)
   - No missing files from the structure
   - All functionality contained within specified files

6. **WandB Integration**:
   - train.py initializes WandB and logs ALL metrics comprehensively:
     * Use `wandb.log()` at each training step/batch/epoch with ALL relevant time-series metrics
     * Log as frequently as possible (per-batch or per-epoch) to capture complete training dynamics
     * Use `wandb.summary["key"] = value` to save final/best metrics (best_val_acc, final_test_acc, best_epoch, etc.)
     * Metric names in train.py's wandb.log() MUST exactly match the keys used in evaluate.py's run.history()
   - Optuna Integration: If using Optuna, DO NOT log intermediate trial results to WandB - only log the final run with best hyperparameters
   - Code must automatically configure based on mode:
     * When `cfg.mode == "trial"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"` before any WandB operations
     * When `cfg.mode == "full"`: Set `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"` before any WandB operations
   - NO results.json or stdout JSON dumps in train.py
   - config/config.yaml contains mandatory WandB settings (entity/project)
   - `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable is available for authentication

7. **Configuration Files**:
   - The generated code properly references config files via Hydra
   - NOTE: config/run/{run_id}.yaml files are provided separately (not in ExperimentCode)
   - All run configurations match the experiment_runs provided
   - Optuna search spaces are properly defined if applicable

8. **Evaluation Script Independence**:
   - evaluate.py is executed independently via `uv run python -m src.evaluate results_dir={path} run_ids='["run-1", "run-2"]'`
   - Accepts `run_ids` parameter as JSON string list (parse with `json.loads(args.run_ids)`)
   - main.py DOES NOT call evaluate.py
   - evaluate.py loads WandB config from `config/config.yaml` (in repository root)
   - evaluate.py retrieves comprehensive data from WandB API:
     * Use `wandb.Api()` to get run data: `run = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}")`
     * Retrieve: `history = run.history()`, `summary = run.summary._json_dict`, `config = dict(run.config)`
   - **STEP 1: Per-Run Processing** (for each run_id):
     * Export comprehensive run-specific metrics to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/metrics.json`
     * Generate run-specific figures (learning curves, confusion matrices) to: `{results_dir}/{run_id}/`
     * Each run should have its own subdirectory with its metrics and figures
   - **STEP 2: Aggregated Analysis** (after processing all runs):
     * Export aggregated metrics to: `{results_dir}/comparison/aggregated_metrics.json`
     * Compute secondary/derived metrics (e.g., improvement rate: (proposed - baseline) / baseline)
     * Generate comparison figures to: `{results_dir}/comparison/`
     * Cross-run comparison charts (bar charts, box plots)
     * Performance metrics tables
     * Statistical significance tests
   - Proper figure quality: legends, annotations, tight_layout
   - Follows GLOBALLY UNIQUE naming convention to prevent collisions:
     * Per-run figures: `{run_id}_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `run-1-proposed-bert-glue_learning_curve.pdf`)
     * Comparison figures: `comparison_{figure_topic}[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf` (e.g., `comparison_accuracy_bar_chart.pdf`)
   - train.py and main.py generate NO figures
   - evaluate.py cannot run in trial_mode (no WandB data available when WandB disabled)

9. **Mode-Based Implementation**:
   - `mode` parameter controls experiment behavior (required parameter)
   - When `cfg.mode == "trial"`:
     * Properly reduces computational load: epochs=1, batches limited to 1-2, Optuna disabled (n_trials=0), small evaluation subset
     * Automatically sets `cfg.wandb.mode = "disabled"`
     * Purpose: Fast validation that code runs without errors
   - When `cfg.mode == "full"`:
     * Automatically sets `cfg.wandb.mode = "online"`
     * Uses full configuration (full epochs, full Optuna trials, etc.)

# Current Research Method
Gradient-Norm Aware Rank Allocation for LoRA (GLoRA)
1. Keep the ordinary LoRA parameterisation W  ←  W  +  Δ where Δ=AB^T,  rank r.
2. During the first Twarmup optimisation steps record, for every trainable weight matrix k, the exponential-moving-average (EMA) of its LoRA gradient Frobenius norm:  g_k  ←  β·g_k  +  (1-β)·||∂L/∂Δ_k||_F.
3. After warm-up compute importance scores  s_k  =  g_k / Σ_j g_j.
4. Given a global rank budget Rtotal (e.g. 128), assign matrix-specific ranks  r_k  =  round( Rtotal · s_k ).  Ensure Σ_k r_k  =  Rtotal by adding / removing 1 where needed.
5. Re-initialise each LoRA layer with its new rank (easy because LoRA stores A∈ℝ^{d×r}, B∈ℝ^{d×r}).  The already learned sub-matrices for the kept columns are copied; extra columns are created with the same init as LoRA; dropped columns are discarded.  Training then continues normally.

Why it should work: the gradient norm is a first-order estimate of how much the loss would change if the associated parameters were perturbed. It therefore correlates with parameter importance but is essentially free to compute (it is produced anyway by back-prop).  Unlike AdaLoRA we do not need an SVD or per-singular-value statistics, so no extra forward / backward passes are introduced.

# Experimental Design
- Strategy: We will verify that the inexpensive gradient-norm aware rank allocation strategy for LoRA (GLoRA) can recover almost all the accuracy benefit of AdaLoRA while keeping training cost identical to vanilla LoRA.  The experiment fine-tunes the encoder-only DeBERTa-v3-base model on the MNLI portion of GLUE using three different parameter-efficient fine-tuning schemes:  (1) ordinary LoRA with a fixed rank of 8 for every projection matrix; (2) AdaLoRA, the published adaptive-rank baseline; (3) the proposed GLoRA.  All runs share the same optimisation schedule and global LoRA-rank budget.  During the first warm-up epoch GLoRA keeps a running EMA of the Frobenius norm of each LoRA gradient; the resulting scores are used to redistribute the fixed total rank across layers.  Because the signal is collected during the normal backward pass, no extra training steps or SVDs are introduced.  At the warm-up boundary the LoRA modules are rebuilt with their newly assigned ranks and training proceeds for the remaining epochs.  We measure development-set accuracy and Matthews correlation on MNLI and record wall-clock training time on one A100 to demonstrate that GLoRA matches AdaLoRA’s accuracy with LoRA-level speed.
- Proposed Method: Gradient-Norm Aware Rank Allocation for LoRA (GLoRA)
Objective: Achieve adaptive allocation of the LoRA rank budget across layers without the heavy SVD-based importance analysis used by AdaLoRA.
Algorithm:
1. Start from the standard LoRA formulation Δ=ABᵀ with an initial uniform rank r_init.
2. For every LoRA layer k maintain an exponential moving average g_k of its gradient Frobenius norm:
   g_k ← β·g_k + (1−β)·∥∂L/∂Δ_k∥_F.
3. Collect g_k during the first T_warmup optimisation steps (one epoch in our setup).
4. After warm-up compute importance scores s_k = g_k / Σ_j g_j and convert them into integer ranks r_k = round(R_total·s_k).  Correct rounding so Σ_k r_k = R_total.
5. Re-initialise each LoRA module with its new rank, copying already learned columns that are kept and randomly initialising added columns.
6. Continue training for the remaining epochs with the redistributed budget.
Implementation details:
• A lightweight wrapper around HuggingFace PEFT registers backward hooks on lora_B weights to accumulate gradient norms, adding virtually zero overhead.
• Rank re-allocation uses the update_layer() utility supplied by PEFT, so no custom CUDA kernels are required.
• Hyper-parameters identical to vanilla LoRA: AdamW, lr=2e-4, batch=32, 3 epochs.  Only β (0.9), T_warmup (1 epoch) and R_total (num_layers×8) are additional.
Theoretical motivation: The gradient norm is a first-order proxy for the loss sensitivity to parameter perturbations; allocating more capacity where this sensitivity is high should maximise loss reduction per parameter—mirroring the intuition behind AdaLoRA but without second-order analysis.

{
    "is_code_ready": false,
    "code_issue": "The repository is NOT ready for immediate execution – several core requirements are violated:\n\n1. GLoRA implementation bugs\n   • Hook is registered on `m.lora_B` (a nn.Linear) – must be `m.lora_B.weight`.  Current call raises AttributeError.\n   • `self.g_ema` is allocated on CPU (model still on CPU at __init__), but gradients will live on GPU after `model.to(DEVICE)`, causing device-mismatch assignment errors.\n\n2. Evaluation script incompleteness / interface mismatch\n   • CLI expected by spec is `results_dir={path}` (Hydra-style key=value).  `src/evaluate.py` treats the first positional argument as *value* and therefore receives the literal string `\"results_dir=/path\"` instead of just the path.\n   • Required per-run figures are incomplete – confusion matrices are missing.\n   • Aggregated analysis lacks box plots and statistical significance tests demanded by the spec.\n\n3. Statistical & visualization requirements unmet\n   • No confusion-matrix figures, no cross-run box plots, no significance testing – violates Core Validation Criterion 8.\n\n4. Rank-allocation reproducibility\n   • `extract_lora_ranks` writes only the final ranks but the train loop never logs / stores intermediate ranks or initial ranks, hampering required “comprehensive” metric logging.\n\nBecause of these issues the code will crash during training and does not satisfy the mandatory evaluation deliverables.  Fix the hook/device errors in `GLoRAWrapper`, complete the evaluation pipeline (confusion matrices, comparison plots, statistical tests, correct CLI parsing), and ensure all required metrics/figures are produced before resubmitting."
